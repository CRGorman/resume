During that time, I observed him not only excelling at his primary job responsibility, application support, but also take on several other tasks not expected of him. Of note, he was asked to take a look at an application that was running slowly. There was virtually no documentation on the application and Chris took it upon himself to review the code and solve the performance problem. Along the way, he also recommended several UI improvements to help users better navigate the application. I was very impressed at how quickly Chris found and solved the issue when other members of the team had failed. Chris has a great attention to detail, it not hesitant to accept any task assigned, and can pick up new technologies very quickly. I would highly recommend him for any technical role for which he applies."
